# 🏥 Insurance Charge Prediction using Machine Learning Pipeline

This project aims to predict medical insurance charges using a machine learning pipeline that streamlines preprocessing and model training. The goal is to develop an end-to-end solution that can accurately estimate insurance costs based on user demographics and health-related attributes.

## 📌 Overview

Medical insurance charges vary depending on personal and health-related features like age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region. This project uses a regression model within a pipeline to predict charges. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, and model fitting.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given the following input features:

- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index.
- **Children**: Number of children covered by the insurance.
- **Smoker**: Smoking status (Yes/No).
- **Region**: Residential region in the US.
- **Charges** (Target): Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

The objective is to train a machine learning model to predict the `charges` based on the input features.
